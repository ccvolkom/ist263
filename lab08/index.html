    <h1>Katie Volkomer's Biography</h1>
    
<main>
    
    <p>Hi! I’m Katie Volkomer.</p>

    <p>
        I am an <strong>Advertising major</strong> with a creative emphasis at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications here at Syracuse. My creative emphasis means that I have a concentration in art direction and will eventually be the one creating the ads. 
        I have lots of experience with the Adobe Suite and have had two creative internships in the past.
    </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Art Director Intern at Camp ADventure with the AdClub at VCU</li>
                <li>Creative Producer Intern at OBERLAND</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
    Outside of work and school, I spend time with my friends and consume hours of content. My day is truly incomplete without scrolling through TikToks or watching YouTube. Also, I’ve recently taken up panting and reading poems. In terms of a favorite poet, I find Emily Dickinson to be perplexing yet elegant and somehow relatable.
    Overall, I’m a creative person just trying to get some tech knowledge!
    </p>
